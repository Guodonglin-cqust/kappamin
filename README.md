# kappamin (under-developed)
A python3 code for calculations of the minimum limit to thermal conductivity

## Features

- Models of the Cahill minimum limit to thermal conductivity
  - Debye model
  - BvK (Bornâ€“von Karman) model
  - Pei model
- Temperature-dependence
  - Finite temperature
  - Ideal infinite temperature
- Relative
  - Heat Capacity
  - Minimum mean-free-path
  - Minimum average phonon lifetime
- Running mode
  - Command line mode based on a simple configuration file (for the routine analysis)
  - Based on prepared scripts (for general researchers without programming skills)
  - Use as a module (for expert usage)
